# update

This is the 16-RELAYS and 16-SS-RELAYS  Card firmware update tool.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SequentMicrosystems/16relind-rpi.git
cd 16relind-rpi/update/
./update 0
```

If you clone the repository already, skip the first step. 
The command will download the newest firmware version from our server and write itÂ  to the board.
The stack level of the board must be provided as a parameter. 
During firmware update we strongly recommend to disconnect all outputs from the board since they can change state unpredictably.
